🐍 My Python Adventure
Hey there! Welcome to my Python learning odyssey!  This repository is where I log my daily grind with Python, breaking down my progress into bite-sized, day-by-day chunks.

Every day, I dive into fresh concepts, tackle problems, and mess around with Python in real-world ways to sharpen my skills.

📂 How This Repo Works
Each day’s folder includes:

📜 Python files (.py): My hands-on coding experiments and answers
📝 Notes & takeaways: Quick thoughts and lessons learned (when I feel like it)
🏆 Tasks & Challenges: Practice problems to lock in what I’ve learned
📚 What I’ve Learned So Far
🔹 Day 01: Python 101, Getting Started & Basics

🔹 Day 02: Playing with Numbers (Arithmetic)

🔹 Day 03: Exploring Modules in Python

(More coming as I keep going!) 🚀
